# DurpDeploy

A single-binary deployment tool for running bash scripts against environments. Define projects, write deployment steps, manage environment-scoped variables, create immutable releases, and deploy them with live log streaming in the browser.

## Features

- **Projects** - Organize deployments into projects
- **Environments** - Define deployment targets (dev, staging, prod) with tags
- **Steps** - Ordered bash scripts that run sequentially during deployment
- **Variables** - Key/value pairs scoped to environments, resolved at deploy time
- **Releases** - Immutable snapshots of steps + variables with version numbers
- **Deployments** - Execute releases against environments with live SSE log streaming
- **Cancel** - Stop running deployments mid-execution

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Node.js (for Tailwind CSS build)
- [templ CLI](https://templ.guide/quick-start/installation)
- [sqlc](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/latest/overview/install.html) (only if modifying queries)

### Build

```bash
npm install
make build
```

This produces a single `durpdeploy` binary.

### Run

```bash
./durpdeploy
```

Server starts on `http://localhost:8080`. A `durpdeploy.db` SQLite file is created automatically on first run.

## Usage

1. **Create a project** - Navigate to Projects → New Project
2. **Add steps** - On the project detail page, add bash script steps in order
3. **Create environments** - Navigate to Environments → New Environment (e.g., "Production" with tag `prod`)
4. **Add variables** - On the project detail page, click Variables. Add key/value pairs scoped to environments
5. **Create a release** - On the project detail page, click Releases. Enter a version (e.g., `1.0.0`)
6. **Deploy** - On the release, select an environment and click Deploy. Watch logs stream in real time.

## Architecture

```
cmd/server/main.go        Entry point
internal/
  handler/                HTTP handlers (chi routes)
  repository/             Thin wrapper around sqlc-generated queries
  runner/                 Deployment execution engine + SSE log broker
  server/                 Router setup
  migrate/                Goose migration runner
migrations/               SQL schema migrations
queries/                  sqlc query definitions
views/                    Templ templates (pages, components, layouts)
static/                   Embedded static assets (JS, CSS)
```

**Stack:** Go + chi + SQLite (modernc.org/sqlite) + sqlc + goose + Templ + HTMX + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI

## Development

```bash
# Generate templ files
make templ-generate

# Build Tailwind CSS
make tailwind-build

# Full build
make build

# Run with hot-reload (requires air or similar)
make dev
```

## What It Does Not Do

- No authentication (single-user local tool)
- No remote deployment targets or SSH
- No parallel step execution
- No CI/build features
- No Kubernetes or cloud integrations
- No PowerShell support (bash only)
